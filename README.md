# CarDealershipSimulator
//Everything works fine
//VERY IMPORTANT: TA/Marker needs to update file path in CarDealershipSimulator.java on line 30 for program to work. Current one is specific to my computer

//Exceptions are used to make sure that program can't crash
//email marco.bozic@ryerson.ca if there are any issues because I could not find any after numerous tests
